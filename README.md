# CarrotCrush

# Background

CarrotCrush is a Candy Crush inspired 1-player game with a healthy spin. The game begins 36 randomly generated blueberries, kiwis, pineapples, strawberries, bananas and carrots. A player can swap adjacent items to complete a row of three or more and add points to their score. Longer streaks and streaks of carrots are worth more points. The object of the game is to reach the level-determined point objective before your number of turns runs out.
